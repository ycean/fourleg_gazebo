Thing to prepare prior runing the script:
** Gurobi license is require for runninng this simulation

This simulation package is the walking robot control with the optimization of  the center of mass of robot in performing the stable walk
The optimization policy is constraint with the zero moment point theory, smoothing the continuous trajectory, and the modal of optimization used is the mixed integer quadratic programming.
